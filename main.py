# (using a GET request to /v1/calls/{call_id}) and check the current 'recording' status.
# Only proceed with the PATCH request if the current status is not already True.

# Reminder on Asynchronous Operations:
# FastAPI and httpx are asynchronous. Ensure your deployment environment (Render)
# is configured to handle asynchronous requests efficiently.
